### Understanding Seattle Airbnb Trends Through  Data-driven Exploration
This journey was embarked on to grasp and understand the details of how Airbnb datasets will be relevant in answering other questions like trends, identifying some relevant response variable and being able to make predictions for them like price and review ratings. These are features that matter to both hosts and future airbnb clients.
This project follows the  Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining(CRISP-DM) approach from start to finish. 

### CRISP-DM MEthodology:

CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a widely used methodology for conducting data mining and analytics projects. 

The CRISP-DM methodology consists of six major phases that guide the project lifecycle:

1. Business Understanding: Understanding the project objectives, requirements, and business goals.
2. Data Understanding: Collecting and exploring the data, understanding its structure, quality, and relationships.
3. Data Preparation: Preparing the data for analysis, including cleaning, transforming, and selecting the relevant variables.
4. Modeling: Selecting and applying appropriate modeling techniques to the data.
5. Evaluation: Evaluating the models' performance and effectiveness in achieving the project objectives.
6. Deployment: Deploying the chosen model and implementing the results into the business environment.
